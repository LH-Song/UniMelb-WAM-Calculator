# About my eQuals

The University of Melbourne now offers certain academic statements in a digital format to download and share, at any time using a secure service provided by My eQuals.

## What are the benefits of digital academic statements?

My eQuals allows you to access your certified documents 24/7 and view them in high definition exactly as they appear on paper. You can share an official copy online with interested parties, such as professional accreditation organisations and other educational institutions.

When sharing online, you can:

- control who can access your document(s) and for how long
- view who accessed your documents and when
- shut-off access to any document, at any time.

## Who can use My eQuals digital academic statements?

- Currently enrolled students\*: you can purchase and access a digital copy of your academic transcript mid-course via my.unimelb.
- Students completing their course: as soon as your course completion is recorded in my.unimelb (and before you graduate) you will receive one free digital academic transcript.
- Graduating students: once you have graduated you will receive free digital certified copies of your graduation certificate (testamur), AHEGS, and academic transcripts (which includes your conferral date).
- Non-Award course students (Community Access Program, Cross-institutional Study, incoming Study Abroad or Exchange): once you have completed your course you will receive access to a free digital certified copy of your academic transcript.

## Are digital academic statements secure?

My eQuals utilises advanced cryptographic hardware and banking level security to produce, and certify digital documents compliant with Australian and international legal and privacy standards.

My eQuals uses advanced electronic signatures which are compliant with EU Digital Signatures Directive 1999/93/EC and national enacting legislation. My eQuals documents are both legally-valid and tamper-evident.
